## Why?
One of the biggest challenges when doing [EEG hyperscanning](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763412001194) (or doing EEG recordings on two or more people at the same time) is to synchronize multiple EEG systems. hyperSynch aims to present a simple and cheap solution to synchronizing multiple EEG systems with each other AND both video and audio. 


## The Basic Idea
This setup lets you use a small button to send a "synchronizing" signal to x amount of EEG systems + an audio recording + video recording so that all of this data can be synchronized for offline analysis.


## Requiered knowledge/skills
* Basic handling of a soldering iron and drill
* Basic programming skills (Arduino)


## The Materials
* x1 6.35mm Jack (not [sure if this one](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/switchcraft-inc/11/SC1085-ND/109515) or [this one](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/switchcraft-inc/12A/SC1089-ND/109527)
* x1 [BNC Female Socket](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/amphenol-rf-division/31-221-RFX/ARFX1064-ND/100648) 
* x2 (or as many EEG systems as you want to synchronize) [DB-25 Parallel Port Female Socket](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/cw-industries/CWR-281-25-0000/CFM25G-ND/59398)
* x1 [Arduino uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno/)
* x1 [AB USB Cable](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/qualtek/3021001-03/Q361-ND/1531288)
* x1 [Project Box](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/bud-industries/CU-1874-B/377-1165-ND/387084)
* x1 [Button]()
* x1 [Sharpie Metallic Permanent Marker](https://www.staples.ca/en/Sharpie-Metallic-Permanent-Markers-Fine-Tip-Silver-2-Pack/product_586069_1-CA_1_20001)
