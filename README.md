## Why?
One of the biggest challenges when doing [EEG hyperscanning](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763412001194) (or doing EEG recordings on two or more people at the same time) is to synchronize multiple EEG systems. hyperSynch aims to present a simple and cheap solution to synchronizing multiple EEG systems with each other AND both video and audio. 

## Requiered knowledge/skills
* Basic handling of a soldering iron and drill
* Basic programming skills (Arduino)

## The Materials
* x1 6.35mm Jack (not [sure if this one](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/switchcraft-inc/11/SC1085-ND/109515) or [this one](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/switchcraft-inc/12A/SC1089-ND/109527)
