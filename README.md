# hyperSynch
One of the biggest challenges when doing [EEG hyperscanning](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763412001194) (or doing EEG recordings on two or more people at the same time) is to synchronize multiple EEG systems. hyperSynch aims to present a simple and cheap solution to synchronizing multiple EEG systems with each other AND both video and audio.
